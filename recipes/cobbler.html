  <h1>Peach Cobbler</h1>
  <img src="../images/cobbler.jpg" alt="A bowl of delicious peach cobbler">

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough
    may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" for its resemblance to a
    cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without all the effort. </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced into thin wedges</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>¼ cup boiling water</li>

    <h3>Mix together</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> 3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon
      juice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 10
      minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt.
      Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water
      until just combined.</li>
    <li>Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and
      cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
